integrate and configure

Requirements Specification:
The goal is to create a scheduling system which will allow students, faculty, and admin to 
complete certain functions as outlined by each class. The systems will require a database of
users that will work for 100 students, 10 instructors, and 1 admin. In addition, it will 
also contain a database of courses, and three types of users. 

Component Analysis:
 Upon researching, there is an existing student registration system on GitHub. This 
 system includes a student and admin log in, as well as functions specific to each
 class. This system also uses commands to query the SQL database. 

Requirements Modifications:
This existing sytems is written in CSS, making it unusable in this context. However, 
it would be nice to have as a reference.

 System Design:
 This system is written using CSS, which would not be applicable to our python-centric
 system. This would have to be addressed, as well as adding an instructor class with its
 appropriate attribues and functions. Additionally, the existing student and admin classes
 would need additional information to meet our system requirements.

Development and Integration:
Since this existing code would be used more for reference than direct implementation,
there would not be much integration required.
