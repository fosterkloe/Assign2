waterfall process model 

Requirements Definition:
The goal is to create a scheduling system which will allow students, faculty, and admin to 
complete certain functions as outlined by each class. The systems will require a database of
users that will work for 100 students, 10 instructors, and 1 admin. In addition, it will 
also contain a database of courses, and three types of users. 

System and Software Design: 
The system will consist of several databases, one with stored users, and one with stored
courses. The three types of users will be students, instructors, and admin, all derrived 
classes from the base class "user". The student class may register, see available courses,
as well as their own schedule. The instructor class may see all available courses, 
as well as their own schedules. The admin class may see everything, and edit courses, users,
and schedules. The system will also include multiple semestersm, print outs, and scheduling 
preferences. The basic attribues for all classes include a first name, last name, and 
identification number. Derrived classes may include addition attributes. Each class will
have functions specific to that class that will allow the user to navigate the system. 

Implementation and Unit Testing: 
For this system, the primary language used will be python with the database in SQL lite. 
For testing, multiple test cases will be used. This includes navigating as multilpe user
types, and selecting various functions to carry out the requirements. 

Integration and System Testing:
The database code will need to be integrated into the main system code. The same testing
procedure will be used for the full system, as multiple test cases will be required to 
ensure the fullfullment of the system requirements.

Operation and Maintenance:
Once the system is written and tested, there will be maintenance required to ensure
that the system continues to run as intended.
